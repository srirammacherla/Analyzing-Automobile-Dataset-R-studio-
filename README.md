# R-studio
# Automobile Dataset Analysis

This repository contains code for the analysis of an automobile dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and linear regression modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "datacsv.csv" file, which contains information about various automobiles, including their attributes such as mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, and car name.

## Code Description

The R code file, named "analysis_script.R," performs various tasks, including data loading, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building linear regression models. The code utilizes several R libraries such as tidyr, dplyr, latticeExtra, psych, caret, magrittr, leaps, gvlma, knitr, and glmnet.

## Instructions for Running the Code

To run the code, ensure that the R environment is set up on your local machine. Clone the repository to your local system and open the "analysis_script.R" file in an R environment or RStudio. Ensure that the "datacsv.csv" file is in the correct directory. Execute the code in sequential order to perform the analysis step-by-step.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the relationship between various automobile attributes and the miles per gallon (mpg) of the vehicles. It includes visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and residual plots, as well as the summary statistics of the dataset.
